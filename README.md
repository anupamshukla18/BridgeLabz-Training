## 📅 Day 9 – Java OOPS: Class & Object
**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: Core OOPS Fundamentals- class and objects)**

- Learned the basic concepts of **`Class`** and **`Object`** in Java.
- Understood how a class defines structure and behavior, while objects represent real-world entities.
- Practiced creating classes with variables and methods, and instantiating multiple objects.
- Gained clarity on how objects interact using method calls.
- Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.
- Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.
- Organized all Class & Object programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.

## 📅 Day 10 – Java OOPS: Constructors & Class-Level Concepts
**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: Constructors, Instance Variables vs Class Variables & Methods)**

- Learned the concept of **`Constructors`** in Java and understood their role in initializing objects.
- Practiced creating default and parameterized constructors to assign initial values to objects.
- Practiced creating classes with variables and methods, and instantiating multiple objects.
- Understood the difference between instance variables (object-specific data) and class-level (static) variables (shared data).
- Implemented programs to observe how static variables maintain a common state across multiple objects.
- Learned the distinction between instance methods and class (static) methods, and when to use each.
- Gained clarity on accessing instance members using objects and class members using the class name.
- Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

## 📅 Day 11 – Java OOPS: Core Java Keywords
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: static, final, this, instanceof)**

- Studied essential **`Java keywords`** and their role in OOPS-based programming.
- Understood the use of static keyword for class-level variables, methods, and shared behavior.
- Learned how final keyword is used to restrict modification of variables, methods, and classes.
- Practiced using this keyword to refer to the current object and resolve ambiguity between instance variables and parameters.
- Gained clarity on the instanceof operator to check object type at runtime.
- Implemented small programs to observe how these keywords affect object behavior and memory usage.
- Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.
- Organized all keyword-based programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.

## 📅 Day 12 – Java OOPS: Object Modeling & Relationships
**(Date: 30-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: Association, Aggregation, Composition, Object Communication)**

- Studied how real-world entities are modeled as Java objects to represent real-time scenarios.
- Understood object relationships and how objects communicate in OOPS.
- Learned Association to represent general relationships between independent objects.
- Practiced Aggregation where the child object can exist independently even if the parent is deleted.
- Implemented Composition to model strong “part-of” relationships where objects depend on the parent’s lifecycle.
- Solved multiple real-world modeling problems like Library–Book, Bank–Customer, Company–Department–Employee, and School–Student–Course.
- Focused on designing meaningful classes, clean structure, and readable OOPS-based Java programs.
- Organized all object modeling programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.
