- > Explored constraints including PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, and their role in maintaining data integrity.

- > Understood transactions and their importance in ensuring reliable database operations.

- > Learned ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for safe and consistent transaction handling.

- > Practiced transaction control commands like START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.

- > Covered additional important concepts such as indexes, normalization basics, and relationships between tables.

- > Focused on writing efficient, consistent, and reliable SQL queries following database best practices.

## 📅 Day 2 – Database & JDBC: Scenario-Based Practice
(Date: 07-02-2026 )
(Focus: Real-World Hospital Management System Using SQL & JDBC)

- > Worked on a comprehensive Hospital Management System covering patient, doctor, appointment, visit, billing, and administration workflows.

- > Applied CRUD operations using SQL to manage patients, doctors, specialties, appointments, and medical records.

- > Used JOIN queries, subqueries, and aggregate functions to retrieve visit history, doctor availability, billing summaries, and revenue reports.

- > Implemented transactions (COMMIT/ROLLBACK) to ensure data consistency during booking, rescheduling, visit recording, and payments.

- > Practiced PreparedStatements for SQL injection prevention, batch operations for bulk inserts, and indexes for performance optimization.

- > Explored advanced database concepts like foreign keys, triggers for audit logging, metadata usage, and connection pooling.
